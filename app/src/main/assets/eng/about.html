<h5>Sri. Akshaykumar

<p>
Sri. Akshaykumar  son of Guruji K Anil kumar first began his studies on Kundalini Yoga when he was 6 years old . He started practicing and teaching the yoga modules regularly under the guidance of Guruji. Modules include Kundalini Yoga, Thambula Kriya and Mashinottam.

He synthesised that Thambula Kriya helps in correcting the chakras to its original cause and eliminate the negative energy around our body. A swan has a special ability which is to separate milk from water while it is drinking the mixture. Likewise Guruji can separate reality from illusion in every moment of life.
